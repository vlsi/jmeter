# Dashboard generator

This document describes the architecture and operation of the
                dashboard generation engine.

The dashboard generation engine is a modular feature based on
                        samples operation processes.
                          

                        The processes can be represented by the following diagram:

In this view, you can see:
                        
                            
                                A source from where samples are produced (e.g. CSV file).
                            
                            
                                A chain of items, named consumers, that operate
                                on the samples
                                that go through the chain
                                (e.g. Filtering, sorting, calculation, …).
                            
                            
                                An execution context, named sample context, where the results
                                of consumers calculations are stored.
                            
                            
                                A set of items, named exporters, that use the content of the
                                sample context to generate a final result to the user (e.g.
                                HTML
                                page generation).

Before producing samples, the source is associated with a sample
                        context that will be used to store the consumers results.

Then a chain of consumers is built using JMeter properties
                        (prefixed by
                        `jmeter.reportgenerator`
                        ) in order to enable the user to customize it.

When the source emits a sample, it sends it to the first consumer
                        of the chain.
                          

                        The consumer can have different behaviors:
                        
                            It can process the sample and send it to the next
                                consumers.
                            It cannot process the sample, so it stores it and
                                continues to
                                receive other samples. When it can process the
                                stored samples, it
                                does so and sends the whole to the next
                                consumers (e.g. sorting).
                            It can choose to discard the sample (e.g.
                                filtering).
                        
                        When the source stops producing samples, consumers can publish a
                        result in the sample context.
                          

                        The latter is send to the set of exporters in order to create
                        results used by final user.



The chain begins with a normalizer consumer in charge of
                    standardizing the timestamp of each sample because JMeter allows
                    different timestamp formats (See
                    `jmeter.save.saveservice.timestamp_format`
                    ).

Then two consumers have to define the start time and end time of
                    the load tests.

At the same level a filter consumer keeps or
                    discards samples
                    depending on the
                    `jmeter.reportgenerator.sample_filter`
                    property.

Another filter is plugged after to discard controller
                    samples.

Depending on the property
                    `jmeter.reportgenerator.graph.<graph_id>.exclude_controllers`
                    , the graph consumer matching the
                    `graph_id`
                    identifier will be
                    set at position
                    `A`
                    or
                    `B`
                    .

The default exporter of the generator use the template engine
                        [freemarker](http://freemarker.org/)
                        to produce html pages.
                          

                        Template files are located in the template
                        directory defined by
                        the JMeter property
                        "`jmeter.reportgenerator.template_dir`"
                        and have
                        the extension "`.fmkr`".

The graph references in the template
                        files use the syntax :
                        `${<graph_id>.<value>}` where :
                        
                            graph_id
                            is the identifier of the graph matching the JMeter
                                properties definition
                            value
                            is the name of the value where data are stored.

Each graph produces the following values :
                        
                            maxX:
                            The maximum abscissa of the graph (double).
                            maxY:
                            The maximum ordinate of the graph (double).
                            minX:
                            The minimum abscissa of the graph (double).
                            minY:
                            The maximum ordinate of the graph (double).
                            title:
                            The title of the graph (string).
                            values:
                            A JSON object representing the data of the graph series
                                  (string).

You can customize the dashboard generation by modifying the
                        files in the
                        template directory.

If you want to add a graph to the dashboard,
                        you have to
                        [declare it among the JMeter properties](#configure_graph)
                        and use its references in the template files.

If you want to remove
                        a graph from the dashboard, you must remove
                        all its references in
                        the template
                        files and clear JMeter
                        properties.

- Till now, there is only one sample source implementation which
                            is strongly coupled with the CSV file format, we should allow
                            other kinds of source by using a sample source interface.
- To add customized graph, users must extend the
                            AbstractGraphConsumer
                            or use one of the implementations provided
                            in the package
                            org.apache.jmeter.report.processor.graph.impl
                            .
                            This could be enhanced by making concrete the base class and
                            give
                            public access to additional properties (like selectors). But
                            first
                            we have to resolve the issue of shared properties (e.g. over
                            time
                            graphs must dispatch the same granularity property to the
                            keys
                            selector and time rate aggregator).
- The chain building is dispatched between the
                            org.apache.jmeter.report.dashboard.ReportGenerator.generate
                            method
                            and the implementation of the consumers. So the code in
                            charge of
                            the building is split and furthermore some consumers can
                            be
                            redundant and harm the performance of report generation, not
                            load testing.
                        
                        
                            E.g. Each
                            LatencyVSRequestGraphConsumer
                            and
                            ResponseTimeVSRequestGraphConsumer
                            instances use an embedded
                            consumer that could be shared depending
                            on
                            granularity
                            and
                            exclude_controllers
                            properties.
                        
                        
                            So we should enable the consumers to define the chain they
                            require and provide a single chain builder that processes these
                            chain requirements to instantiate needed consumers on demand.
                            I.e.
                            for the same chain requirement declaration, the same consumer
                            instances are used. Otherwise if the declaration differs, a new
                            branch of consumers is created.
- The graphs (DOM elements) in the generated HTML page should be
                            dynamically build in order to match the graphs defined in JMeter
                            properties.
- Some improvements can be done on the generated html pages:
                            
                                Using a single page, and hide graphs depending on the
                                    navigation menu selection.
                                Adding a loading animation when graphs are build or
                                    refreshed.
                                Let the user determine if a graph is zoomable using a JMeter
                                    property.
                                
                                    Using the
                                    jquery.plot.setData()
                                    method to handle series
                                    activation/deactivation rather than
                                    rebuild the graph.
