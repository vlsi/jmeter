# Generate Summary Results

![Generate Summary Results](/img/images/screenshots/summary.png)

`n`seconds (default 30 seconds) on the appropriate
time boundary, so that multiple test runs on the same time will be synchronised.:::note
Since a summary/differential line is written only if there are samples emitted, the interval
for generation may not be respected if your test has no sample generated within the interval
:::

See`jmeter.properties`file for the summariser configuration items:```

# Define the following property to automatically start a summariser with that name
# (applies to CLI mode only)
#summariser.name=summary
#
# interval between summaries (in seconds) default 3 minutes
#summariser.interval=30
#
# Write messages to log file
#summariser.log=true
#
# Write messages to System.out
#summariser.out=true

```

This element is mainly intended for batch (CLI) runs.
The output looks like the following:```

The "`label`" is the name of the element.
The`"+"`means that the line is a delta line, i.e. shows the changes since the last output.  
The`"="`means that the line is a total line, i.e. it shows the running total.  
Entries in the JMeter log file also include time-stamps.
The example "`817 in 0:05:07 =    2.7/s`" means that there were 817 samples recorded in 5 minutes and 7 seconds,
and that works out at 2.7 samples per second.  
The`Avg`(Average),`Min`(Minimum) and`Max`(Maximum) times are in milliseconds.  
"`Err`" means number of errors (also shown as percentage).  
The last two lines will appear at the end of a test.
They will not be synchronised to the appropriate time boundary.
Note that the initial and final deltas may be for less than the interval (in the example above this is 30 seconds).
The first delta will generally be lower, as JMeter synchronizes to the interval boundary.
The last delta will be lower, as the test will generally not finish on an exact interval boundary.The label is used to group sample results together.
So if you have multiple Thread Groups and want to summarize across them all, then use the same label
 - or add the summariser to the Test Plan (so all thread groups are in scope).
Different summary groupings can be implemented
by using suitable labels and adding the summarisers to appropriate parts of the test plan.

:::note
In CLI mode by default a Generate Summary Results listener named "`summariser`" is configured, if you have already added one to your Test Plan, ensure you name it differently
otherwise results will be accumulated under this label (summary) leading to wrong results (sum of total samples + samples located under the Parent of Generate Summary Results listener).  

This is not a bug but a design choice allowing to summarize across thread groups.
