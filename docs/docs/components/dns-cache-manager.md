# DNS Cache Manager

![DNS Cache Manager](/img/images/screenshots/dns-cache-manager.png)

The DNS Cache Manager element allows to test applications, which have several servers behind load balancers (CDN, etc.),
    when user receives content from different IP's. By default JMeter uses JVM DNS cache. That's why
    only one server from the cluster receives load. DNS Cache Manager resolves names for each thread separately each iteration and
    saves results of resolving to its internal DNS Cache, which is independent from both JVM and OS DNS caches.

A mapping for static hosts can be used to simulate something like `/etc/hosts` file.
    These entries will be preferred over the custom resolver. `Use custom DNS resolver` has to be enabled,
    if you want to use this mapping.

Say, you have a test server, that you want to reach with a name, that is not (yet) set up in your DNS servers.
    For our example, this would be `www.example.com` for the server name, which you want to reach at the
    IP of the server `a123.another.example.org`.

You could change your workstation and add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file - or the equivalent for
    your OS, or add an entry to the Static Host Table of the DNS Cache Manager.

You would type `www.example.com` into the first column (`Host`) and
    `a123.another.example.org` into the second column (`Hostname or IP address`).
    As the name of the second column implies, you could even use the IP address of your test server there.

The IP address for the test server will be looked up by using the custom DNS resolver. When none is given, the
    system DNS resolver will be used.

Now you can use `www.example.com` in your HTTPClient4 samplers and the requests will be made against
    `a123.another.example.org` with all headers set to `www.example.com`.
