# 10. Building a JMS Point-to-Point Test Plan

:::note
Make sure the required jar files are in JMeter's `lib` directory. If they are not, shutdown JMeter,
            copy the jar files over and restart JMeter.
            See [Getting Started](get-started.html#libraries_activemq) for details.
:::

In this section, you will learn how to create a
                [Test Plan](build-test-plan.html) to test a JMS Point-to-Point messaging solution.
The setup of the test is 1 threadgroup with 5 threads sending 4 messages each through a request queue.
A fixed reply queue will be used for monitoring the reply messages.
To construct the Test Plan, you will use the
following elements:
                [Thread Group](test_plan.html#thread_group),
                [JMS Point-to-Point](#jms-point-to-point), and
                [Graph Results](#graph-results).

General notes on JMS: There are currently two JMS samplers. One uses JMS topics
and the other uses queues. Topic messages are commonly known as pub/sub messaging.
Topic messaging is generally used in cases where a message is published by a producer and
consumed by multiple subscribers.  A JMS sampler needs the JMS implementation jar files;
for example, from Apache ActiveMQ.  See [here](get-started.html#libraries_activemq) for the list
of jars provided by ActiveMQ.

# 10.1 Adding a Thread Group

The first step you want to do with every JMeter Test Plan is to add a
                [Thread Group](test_plan.html#thread_group) element.  The Thread Group tells
JMeter the number of users you want to simulate, how often the users should send
requests, and the how many requests they should send.

Go ahead and add the ThreadGroup element by first selecting the Test Plan,
clicking your right mouse button to get the Add menu, and then select

  Add
  ThreadGroup
.

You should now see the Thread Group element under Test Plan.  If you do not
see the element, then "expand" the Test Plan tree by clicking on the
Test Plan element.

Next, you need to modify the default properties.  Select the Thread Group element
in the tree, if you have not already selected it. You should now see the Thread
Group Control Panel in the right section of the JMeter window (see Figure 10.1
below)

Start by providing a more descriptive name for our Thread Group. In the name
field, enter `Point-to-Point`.

Next, increase the number of users (called threads) to `5`.

In the next field, the Ramp-Up Period, leave set the value to 0
seconds.  This property tells JMeter how long to delay between starting each
user. For example, if you enter a Ramp-Up Period of 5 seconds, JMeter will
finish starting all of your users by the end of the 5 seconds.  So, if we have
5 users and a 5 second Ramp-Up Period, then the delay between starting users
would be 1 second (5 users / 5 seconds = 1 user per second).  If you set the
value to 0, then JMeter will immediately start all of your users.

Clear the checkbox labeled "`Forever`", and enter a value of `4` in the Loop
Count field.  This property tells JMeter how many times to repeat your test.
If you enter a loop count value of `0`, then JMeter will run your test only
once. To have JMeter repeatedly run your Test Plan, select the `Forever`
checkbox.

:::note
In most applications, you have to manually accept
changes you make in a Control Panel.  However, in JMeter, the Control Panel
automatically accepts your changes as you make them.  If you change the
name of an element, the tree will be updated with the new text after you
leave the Control Panel (for example, when selecting another tree element).

# 10.2 Adding JMS Point-to-Point Sampler

Start by adding the sampler [JMS Point-to-Point](#jms-point-to-point)
to the Point-to-Point element
(
  Add
  Sampler
  JMS Point-to-Point
).
Then, select the JMS Point-to-Point sampler element in the tree.
 In building the example a configuration will be provided that works with ActiveMQ 3.0.

Name
                        Value
                        Description
                    
                    
                    
                        JMS Resources
                    
                    
                        QueueConnectionFactory
                        ConnectionFactory
                         This is the default JNDI entry for the connection factory within ActiveMQ.
                    
                    
                        JNDI Name Request Queue
                        Q.REQ
                        This is equal to the JNDI name defined in the JNDI properties.
                    
                    
                        JNDI Name Reply Queue
                        Q.RPL
                        This is equal to the JNDI name defined in the JNDI properties.
                    
                    
                        Message Properties
                    
                    
                        Communication Style
                        Request Response
                        This means that you need at least a service running outside of JMeter and that will respond to the requests.
                        This service must listen to the Request Queue and send messages to the queue referenced by the message.getJMSReplyTo()
                    
                    
                        Content
                        test
                        This is just the content of the message.
                    
                    
                        JMS Properties
                        
                        Nothing needed for ActiveMQ.
                    
                    
                         JNDI Properties
                     
                     
                        InitialContextFactory
                        org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory
                        The standard InitialContextFactory for ActiveMQ
                    
                    
                         Properties
                    
                    
                        queue.Q.REQ
                        example.A
                        This defines a JNDI name Q.REQ for the request queue that points to the queue example.A
                    
                    
                        queue.Q.RPL
                        example.B
                        This defines a JNDI name Q.RPL for the reply queue that points to the queue example.B
                    
                    
                        Provider URL
                    
                    
                        Provider URL
                        tcp://localhost:61616
                        This defines the URL of the ActiveMQ messaging system.

# 10.3 Adding a Listener to View Store the Test Results

The final element you need to add to your Test Plan is a
                [Listener](component_reference.html#listeners). This element is
responsible for storing all of the results of your JMS requests in a file and presenting
a visual model of the data.

Select the Thread Group element and add a
                [Graph Results](#graph-results) listener
(
  Add
  Listener
  Graph Results
).  Next, you need to specify a directory and filename of the
output file.  You can either type it into the filename field, or select the
Browse button and browse to a directory and then enter a filename.
