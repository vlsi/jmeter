# 21. Regular Expressions

JMeter includes the pattern matching software [Apache Jakarta ORO](http://attic.apache.org/projects/jakarta-oro.html)
  

There is some documentation for this on the Jakarta web-site, for example
[
a summary of the pattern matching characters](http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/scrapbook/jakarta-oro-2.0.6/docs/api/org/apache/oro/text/regex/package-summary.html)

There is also documentation on an older incarnation of the product at
[OROMatcher User's guide](http://www.savarese.org/oro/docs/OROMatcher/index.html), which might prove useful.

:::note
With JMeter version 5.5 the Regex implementation can be switched from Oro to the JDK based one by setting
the JMeter property `jmeter.regex.engine` to some value different than `oro`.
:::

The pattern matching is very similar to the pattern matching in Perl.
A full installation of Perl will include plenty of documentation on regular expressions - look for `perlrequick`,
`perlretut`, `perlre` and `perlreref`.

It is worth stressing the difference between "*contains*" and "*matches*", as used on the Response Assertion test element:

"*contains*"means that the regular expression matched at least some part of the target,
so '`alphabet`' "*contains*" '`ph.b.`' because the regular expression matches the substring '`phabe`'."*matches*"means that the regular expression matched the whole target.
So '`alphabet`' is "*matched*" by '`al.*t`'.In this case, it is equivalent to wrapping the regular expression in `^` and `$`, viz '`^al.*t$`'.

However, this is not always the case.
For example, the regular expression '`alp|.lp.*`' is "*contained*" in '`alphabet`',
but does not "*match*" '`alphabet`'.

Why? Because when the pattern matcher finds the sequence '`alp`' in '`alphabet`', it stops trying any other
combinations - and '`alp`' is not the same as '`alphabet`', as it does not include '`habet`'.

:::note
Unlike Perl, there is no need to (i.e. do not) enclose the regular expression in `//`.
:::

So how does one use the modifiers `ismx` etc. if there is no trailing `/`?
The solution is to use *extended regular expressions*, i.e. `/abc/i` becomes `(?i)abc`.
See also [Placement of modifiers](#placement) below.

### Extract single string

Suppose you want to match the following portion of a web-page:
  

`name="file" value="readme.txt">`
  

and you want to extract `readme.txt`.
  

A suitable regular expression would be:
  

`name="file" value="(.+?)">`

The special characters above are:


( and )these enclose the portion of the match string to be returned
.match any character
+one or more times
?don't be greedy, i.e. stop when first match succeeds


Note: without the ?, the .+ would continue past the first ">
until it found the last possible "> - which is probably not what was intended.


Note: although the above expression works, it's more efficient to use the following expression:

name="file" value="([^"]+)">
where
[^"] - means match anything except "
In this case, the matching engine can stop looking as soon as it sees the first ",
whereas in the previous case the engine has to check that it has found "> rather than say " >.

Extract multiple strings

Suppose you want to match the following portion of a web-page:
name="file.name" value="readme.txt"
and you want to extract both file.name and readme.txt.

A suitable regular expression would be:

name="([^"]+)" value="([^"]+)"

This would create 2 groups, which could be used in the JMeter Regular Expression Extractor template as $1$ and $2$.


The JMeter Regex Extractor saves the values of the groups in additional variables.


For example, assume:


Reference Name: MYREF
Regex: name="(.+?)" value="(.+?)"
Template: $1$$2$

Do not enclose the regular expression in / /

The following variables would be set:


MYREFfile.namereadme.txt
MYREF_g0name="file.name" value="readme.txt"
MYREF_g1file.name
MYREF_g2readme.txt

These variables can be referred to later on in the JMeter test plan, as `${MYREF}`, `${MYREF_g1}` etc.

The pattern matching behaves in various slightly different ways,
depending on the setting of the multi-line and single-line modifiers.
Note that the single-line and multi-line operators have nothing to do with each other;
they can be specified independently.

### Single-line mode

Single-line mode only affects how the '`.`' meta-character is interpreted.

Default behaviour is that '`.`' matches any character except newline.
In single-line mode, '`.`' also matches newline.

### Multi-line mode

Multi-line mode only affects how the meta-characters '`^`' and '`$`' are interpreted.

Default behaviour is that '`^`' and '`$`' only match at the very beginning and end of the string.
When Multi-line mode is used, the '`^`' metacharacter matches at the beginning of every line,
and the '`$`' metacharacter matches at the end of every line.

Regular expressions use certain characters as meta characters - these characters have a special meaning to the RE engine.
Such characters must be escaped by preceding them with `\` (backslash) in order to treat them as ordinary characters.
Here is a list of the meta characters and their meaning (please check the ORO documentation if in doubt).

`(`and`)`grouping`[`and`]`character classes`{`and`}`repetition`*`,`+`and`?`repetition`.`wild-card character`\`escape character`|`alternatives`^`and`$`start and end of string or line:::note
Please note that ORO does not support the `\Q` and `\E` meta-characters.
[In other RE engines, these can be used to quote a portion of an RE so that the meta-characters stand for themselves.]
You can use function  to do the equivalent, see [${__escapeOroRegexpChars(valueToEscape)}](functions.html#__escapeOroRegexpChars).
:::

The following Perl5 extended regular expressions are supported by ORO.


(?#text)
An embedded comment causing text to be ignored.
(?:regexp)
Groups things like "()" but doesn't cause the group match to be saved.
(?=regexp)
A zero-width positive lookahead assertion. For example, \w+(?=\s) matches a word followed by whitespace, without including whitespace in the MatchResult.
(?!regexp)
A zero-width negative lookahead assertion. For example foo(?!bar) matches any occurrence of "foo" that
isn't followed by "bar". Remember that this is a zero-width assertion, which means that a(?!b)d will
match ad because a is followed by a character that is not b (the d) and a d
follows the zero-width assertion.
(?imsx)
One or more embedded pattern-match modifiers. i enables case insensitivity, m enables multiline treatment
of the input, s enables single line treatment of the input, and x enables extended whitespace comments.

**Note that `(?<=regexp)` - lookbehind - is not supported.**

Modifiers can be placed anywhere in the regex, and apply from that point onwards.
[A bug in ORO means that they cannot be used at the very end of the regex.
However they would have no effect there anyway.]

The single-line `(?s)` and multi-line `(?m)` modifiers are normally placed at the start of the regex.

The ignore-case modifier `(?i)` may be usefully applied to just part of a regex,
for example:

```

Match ExAct case or (?i)ArBiTrARY(?-i) case

```

would match`Match ExAct case or arbitrary case`as well as`Match ExAct case or ARBitrary case`, but not`Match exact case or ArBiTrARY case`.# 21.6 Testing Regular Expressions

Since JMeter 2.4, the listener [View Results Tree](component_reference.html#View_Results_Tree)
include a RegExp Tester to test regular expressions directly on sampler response data.

There is a [Website](http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html) to test Java Regular expressions.

Another approach is to use a simple test plan to test the regular expressions.
The Java Request sampler can be used to generate a sample, or the HTTP Sampler can be used to load a file.
Add a Debug Sampler and a Tree View Listener and changes to the regular expression can be tested quickly,
without needing to access any external servers.
