# 12. Introduction to listeners

A listener is a component that shows the results of the
samples. The results can be shown in a tree, tables, graphs or simply written to a log
file. To view the contents of a response from any given sampler, add either of the Listeners "`View
Results Tree`" or "`View Results in table`" to a test plan. To view the response time graphically, add
graph results.
The [listeners](#listeners)
section of the components page has full descriptions of all the listeners.

:::note
Different listeners display the response information in different ways.
However, they all write the same raw data to the output file - if one is specified.
:::

The "`Configure`" button can be used to specify which fields to write to the file, and whether to
write it as CSV or XML.
CSV files are much smaller than XML files, so use CSV if you are generating lots of samples.

The file name can be specified using either a relative or an absolute path name.
Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (which defaults to the `bin/` directory).
JMeter also supports paths relative to the directory containing the current test plan (JMX file).
If the path name begins with "`~/`" (or whatever is in the `jmeter.save.saveservice.base_prefix` JMeter property),
then the path is assumed to be relative to the JMX file location.

If you only wish to record certain samples, add the Listener as a child of the sampler.
Or you can use a Simple Controller to group a set of samplers, and add the Listener to that.
The same filename can be used by multiple samplers - but make sure they all use the same configuration!

# 12.1 Default Configuration

The default items to be saved can be defined in the `jmeter.properties` (or `user.properties`) file.
The properties are used as the initial settings for the Listener Config pop-up, and are also
used for the log file specified by the `-l` command-line flag (commonly used for CLI mode test runs).

To change the default format, find the following line in `jmeter.properties`:

```
jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=
```

The information to be saved is configurable.  For maximum information, choose "`xml`" as the format and specify "`Functional Test Mode`" on the Test Plan element.  If this box is not checked, the default saved
data includes a time stamp (the number of milliseconds since midnight,
January 1, 1970 UTC), the data type, the thread name, the label, the
response time, message, and code, and a success indicator.  If checked, all information, including the full response data will be logged.

The following example indicates how to set
properties to get a vertical bar ("`|`") delimited format that will
output results like:.

```

timeStamp|time|label|responseCode|threadName|dataType|success|failureMessage
02/06/03 08:21:42|1187|Home|200|Thread Group-1|text|true|
02/06/03 08:21:42|47|Login|200|Thread Group-1|text|false|Test Failed:
    expected to contain: password etc.

```

The corresponding `jmeter.properties` that need to be set are shown below.  One oddity
in this example is that the `output_format` is set to `csv`, which
typically
indicates comma-separated values.  However, the `default_delimiter` was
set to be a vertical bar instead of a comma, so the csv tag is a
misnomer in this case. (Think of CSV as meaning character separated values)

```

jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=csv
jmeter.save.saveservice.assertion_results_failure_message=true
jmeter.save.saveservice.default_delimiter=|

```

The full set of properties that affect result file output is shown below.

#jmeter.save.saveservice.print_field_names=true

# Optional list of JMeter variable names whose values are to be saved in the result data files.
# Use commas to separate the names. For example:
#sample_variables=SESSION_ID,REFERENCE
# N.B. The current implementation saves the values in XML as attributes,
# so the names must be valid XML names.
# JMeter sends the variable to all servers
# to ensure that the correct data is available at the client.

# Optional xml processing instruction for line 2 of the file:
#jmeter.save.saveservice.xml_pi=<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="sample.xsl"?>

# Prefix used to identify filenames that are relative to the current base
#jmeter.save.saveservice.base_prefix=~/

# AutoFlush on each line written in XML or CSV output
# Setting this to true will result in less test results data loss in case of Crash
# but with impact on performances, particularly for intensive tests (low or no pauses)
# Since JMeter 2.10, this is false by default
#jmeter.save.saveservice.autoflush=false

# Put the start time stamp in logs instead of the end
sampleresult.timestamp.start=true

# Whether to use System.nanoTime() - otherwise only use System.currentTimeMillis()
#sampleresult.useNanoTime=true

# Use a background thread to calculate the nanoTime offset
# Set this to ≤ 0 to disable the background thread
#sampleresult.nanoThreadSleep=5000

```

The date format to be used for the `timestamp_format` is described in [
SimpleDateFormat]().
The timestamp format is used for both writing and reading files.
If the format is set to "`ms`", and the column does not parse as a long integer,
JMeter (2.9+) will try the following formats:

yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss (this is for compatibility with previous versions; it is not recommended as a format)

Matching is now also strict (non-lenient).
JMeter 2.8 and earlier used lenient mode which could result in timestamps with incorrect dates
(times were usually correct).

JMeter supports the `sample_variables`
property to define a list of additional JMeter variables which are to be saved with
each sample in the JTL files. The values are written to CSV files as additional columns,
and as additional attributes in XML files. See above for an example.

Listeners can be configured to save different items to the result log files (JTL) by using the Config popup as shown below.
The defaults are defined as described in  the [Listener Default Configuration](#defaults) section above.
Items with (CSV) after the name only apply to the CSV format; items with (XML) only apply to XML format.
CSV format cannot currently be used to save any items that include line-breaks.

Note that cookies, method and the query string are saved as part of the "`Sampler Data`" option.

# 12.2 CLI mode (batch) test runs

When running in CLI mode, the `-l` flag can be used to create a top-level listener for the test run.
This is in addition to any Listeners defined in the test plan.
The configuration of this listener is controlled by entries in the file `jmeter.properties`
as described in the previous section.

This feature can be used to specify different data and log files for each test run, for example:

```

jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l testplan_01.jtl -j testplan_01.log
jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l testplan_02.jtl -j testplan_02.log

```

Note that JMeter logging messages are written to the file `jmeter.log` by default.
This file is recreated each time, so if you want to keep the log files for each run,
you will need to rename it using the `-j` option as above.

JMeter supports variables in the log file name.
If the filename contains  paired single-quotes, then the name is processed
as a `SimpleDateFormat` format applied to the current date, for example:
`log_file='jmeter_'yyyyMMddHHmmss'.tmp'`.
This can be used to generate a unique name for each test run.

# 12.3 Resource usage

:::note
Listeners can use a lot of memory if there are a lot of samples.
:::

Most of the listeners currently keep a copy of every sample they display, apart from:

- Simple Data Writer
- BeanShell/JSR223 Listener
- Mailer Visualizer
- Monitor Results
- Summary Report

The following Listeners no longer need to keep copies of every single sample.
Instead, samples with the same elapsed time are aggregated.
Less memory is now needed, especially if most samples only take a second or two at most.

- Aggregate Report
- Aggregate Graph

To minimize the amount of memory needed, use the Simple Data Writer, and use the CSV format.

# 12.4 CSV Log format

The CSV log format depends on which data items are selected in the configuration.
Only the specified data items are recorded in the file.
The order of appearance of columns is fixed, and is as follows:

- `timeStamp` - in milliseconds since 1/1/1970
- `elapsed` - in milliseconds
- `label` - sampler label
- `responseCode` - e.g. `200`, `404`
- `responseMessage` - e.g. `OK`
- `threadName`
- `dataType` - e.g. `text`
- `success` - `true` or `false`
- `failureMessage` - if any
- `bytes` - number of bytes in the sample
- `sentBytes` - number of bytes sent for the sample
- `grpThreads` - number of active threads in this thread group
- `allThreads` - total number of active threads in all groups
- `URL`
- `Filename` - if `Save Response to File` was used
- `latency` - time to first response
- `connect` - time to establish connection
- `encoding`
- `SampleCount` - number of samples (1, unless multiple samples are aggregated)
- `ErrorCount` - number of errors (0 or 1, unless multiple samples are aggregated)
- `Hostname` - where the sample was generated
- `IdleTime` - number of milliseconds of 'Idle' time (normally 0)
- `Variables`, if specified

# 12.5 XML Log format 2.1

The format of the updated XML (2.1) is as follows (line breaks will be different):

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<testResults version="1.2">

# 12.6 XML Log format 2.2

The format of the JTL files is identical for 2.2 and 2.1. Format 2.2 only affects JMX files.

# 12.7 Sample Attributes

The sample attributes have the following meaning:

| Attribute | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `by` | Bytes |
| `sby` | Sent Bytes |
| `de` | Data encoding |
| `dt` | Data type |
| `ec` | Error count (0 or 1, unless multiple samples are aggregated) |
| `hn` | Hostname where the sample was generated |
| `it` | Idle Time = time not spent sampling (milliseconds) (generally 0) |
| `lb` | Label |
| `lt` | Latency = time to initial response (milliseconds) - not all samplers support this |
| `ct` | Connect Time = time to establish the connection (milliseconds) - not all samplers support this |
| `na` | Number of active threads for all thread groups |
| `ng` | Number of active threads in this group |
| `rc` | Response Code (e.g. `200`) |
| `rm` | Response Message (e.g. `OK`) |
| `s` | Success flag (`true`/`false`) |
| `sc` | Sample count (1, unless multiple samples are aggregated) |
| `t` | Elapsed time (milliseconds) |
| `tn` | Thread Name |
| `ts` | timeStamp (milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970 UTC) |
| `varname` | Value of the named variable |

:::note
JMeter allows additional variables to be saved with the test plan.
Currently, the variables are saved as additional attributes.
The testplan variable name is used as the attribute name.
See [Sample variables](#sample_variables) (above) for more information.
:::

# 12.8 Saving response data

As shown above, the response data can be saved in the XML log file if required.
However, this can make the file rather large, and the text has to be encoded so
that it is still valid XML. Also, images cannot be included.
Only sample responses with the type `TEXT` can be saved.
  

Another solution is to use the Post-Processor [Save_Responses_to_a_file](#save_responses_to_a_file).
This generates a new file for each sample, and saves the file name with the sample.
The file name can then be included in the sample log output.
The data will be retrieved from the file if necessary when the sample log file is reloaded.

# 12.9 Loading (reading) response data

To view an existing results file, you can use the File "`Browse…`" button to select a file.
If necessary, just create a dummy testplan with the appropriate Listener in it.

Results can be read from XML or CSV format files.
When reading from CSV results files, the header (if present) is used to determine which fields were saved.
**In order to interpret a header-less CSV file correctly, the appropriate JMeter properties must be set.**

:::note
JMeter does not clear any current data before loading the new file thus allowing files to be merged.
If you want to clear the current data, use the menu item:
  
    Run
    Clear
    
      
        Ctrl
        Shift
        E
      
    
  
or
  
    Run
    Clear All
    
      
        Ctrl
        E
      
    
  
before loading the file.
:::

# 12.10 Saving Listener GUI data

JMeter is capable of saving any listener as a PNG file. To do so, select the
listener in the left panel. Click
  
    Edit
    Save Node As Image
  .
A file dialog will
appear. Enter the desired name and save the listener.

The Listeners which generate output as tables can also be saved using Copy/Paste.
Select the desired cells in the table, and use the OS Copy short-cut (normally Ctrl+C).
The data will be saved to the clipboard, from where it can be pasted into another application,
e.g. a spreadsheet or text editor.
