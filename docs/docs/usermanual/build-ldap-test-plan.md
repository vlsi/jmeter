# 8a. Building an LDAP Test Plan

In this section, you will learn how to create a basic Test Plan to test an LDAP server.
You will create four users that send requests for four tests on the LDAP server. Also, you will tell
the users to run their tests 4 times. So,  the total number of requests is (4 users) x (4 requests) x
(repeat 4 times) = 64 LDAP requests. To construct the Test Plan, you will use the following elements:
[Thread Group](test_plan.html#thread_group),
[LDAP Request](#ldap-request),
[LDAP Request Defaults](#ldap-request-defaults), and
[View Results in Table](#view-results-in-table)
.

This example assumes that the LDAP Server is available at ldap.test.com.

# 8a.1 Adding Users

The first step you want to do with every JMeter Test Plan is to add a Thread Group element.
The Thread Group tells JMeter the number of users you want to simulate, how often the users should send
requests, and the how many requests  they should send.

Go ahead and add the ThreadGroup element by first selecting the Test Plan, clicking your
right mouse button to get the Add menu, and then select

  Add
  ThreadGroup
. You should now see the
Thread Group element under Test Plan. If you do not see the element, then "expand" the Test Plan tree by
clicking on the Test Plan element.

# 8a.2 Adding Login Config Element

Begin by selecting the `LDAP Users` element. Click your right mouse
button to get the Add menu, and then select
  
    Add
    Config Element
    Login Config Element
  .
Then,  select this new element to view its Control Panel.

Like most JMeter elements, the `Login  Config Element`'s Control Panel has a name
field that you can modify. In this example, leave this field with the default value.

:::note
Enter Username field to "your LDAP Username",
        The password field to "your LDAP Password"

        These values will be used by the LDAP Requests.
:::

# 8a.3 Adding LDAP Request Defaults

Begin by selecting the `LDAP Users` element. Click your right mouse button
to get the Add menu, and then select

  Add
  Config Element
  LDAP Request Defaults
. Then,
select this new element to view its Control Panel.

Like most JMeter elements, the `LDAP Request Defaults` Control Panel has a name
field that you can modify. In this example, leave this field with the default value.

:::note
Enter `DN` field to "`your LDAP Root Distinguished Name`".  

                Enter LDAP Server's `Servername` field to "`ldap.test.com`".  

        The `port` to `389`.  

        These values are default for the LDAP Requests.
:::

# 8a.4 Adding LDAP Requests

In our Test Plan, we need to make four LDAP requests.

1. Inbuilt Add Test
2. Inbuilt Search Test
3. Inbuilt Modify Test
4. Inbuilt Delete Test

JMeter sends requests in the order that you add them to the tree.
Start by adding the first LDAP Request to the LDAP Users element
(
  Add
  Sampler
  LDAP Request
). Then, select the LDAP Request  element in the tree
and edit the following properties

1. Rename to "`Add`" this element
2. Select the `Add Test` radio button in `Test Configuration` group

You do not have to set the `Servername` field, `port` field, `Username`, `Password`
and `DN` because you already specified this value in the `Login Config Element` and
`LDAP Request Defaults.`

Next, add the second LDAP Request and edit the following
properties

1. Rename to "`Search`" this element
2. Select the `Search Test` radio button in `Test Configuration` group

Next, add the Third LDAP Request and edit the following properties

1. Rename to "`Modify`" this element
2. Select the `Modify Test` radio button in `Test Configuration` group

Next, add the fourth LDAP Request and edit the following properties

1. Rename to "`Delete`" this element
2. Select the `Delete Test` radio button in `Test Configuration` group

# 8a.5 Adding a Response Assertion

You can add a Response Assertion element.
 This element will check the received response data by verifying if the response text is "`successful`".
  (
  Add
  Assertion
  Response Assertion
).

:::note
Note: A this position in the tree,
  the Response Assertion will be executed for each LDAP Request.
:::

1. Select `Text Response` Radio button in `Response Field to Test` group
2. Select `Substring` Radio button in `Pattern Matching Rules` group
3. Click on `Add` button and add the string "`successful`" in `Pattern to Test` field

# 8a.6 Adding a Listener to View/Store the Test Results

The final element you need to add to your Test Plan is a Listener.
 This element is responsible for storing all of the results of your LDAP
requests in a file  and presenting a visual model of the data. Select the LDAP
Users element and add a View Results in Table
(
Add
Listener
View Results in Table
)
