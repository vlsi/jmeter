# 27. JUnit Sampler Tutorial

This tutorial attempts to explain the basic design, functionality and usage of the new JUnit Sampler for JMeter.
The sampler was introduced in version 2.1.2 release of JMeter. Earlier releases do not have the sampler.

The current implementation supports standard JUnit convention and extensions, like `oneTimeSetUp`
and `oneTimeTearDown`. Other features can be added on request. The sampler works like the JavaSampler
with some differences.

- Rather than use JMeter's test interface, it scans the jar files for classes extending JUnit's
      `TestCase` class. This means any class or subclass.
- JUnit test jar files are copied to `jmeter/lib/junit` instead of
      `jmeter/lib`
- JUnit sampler does not use name/value pairs for configuration. The sampler assumes
      `setUp` and `tearDown` will configure the test correctly.
      Note: setUp and tearDown methods must be declared public,
       so that JMeter can use it.
- The sampler measures the elapsed time only for the test method and does not include
      `setUp` and `tearDown`.
- Each time the test method is called, JMeter will pass the result to the listeners.
- Support for `oneTimeSetUp` and `oneTimeTearDown` is done as a method.
      Since JMeter is multi-threaded, we cannot call `oneTimeSetUp`/`oneTimeTearDown`
      the same way maven does it.
- The sampler reports unexpected exceptions as errors.

Here is a description of the functionality.

Namename for the sample. This is the same as all JMeter samplers.Package Filterprovides a way to filter the classes by package name.Classnamethe name of the class to test. The sampler will scan the jar files in`jmeter/lib/ext`and`jmeter/lib/junit`for classes extending
      JUnit's`TestCase`.Constructor Stringa string to pass to the string constructor of the test class.Test Methodthe name of the method to test in the sampler.Success messagea descriptive message indicating what success means.Success codean unique code indicating the test was successful.Failure messagea descriptive message indicating what failure means.Failure codean unique code indicating the test failedError messagea description for errorsError codesome code for errors. Does not need to be uniqueDo not call`setUp`and`tearDown`set the sampler not
      to call`setUp`and`tearDown`. By default,`setUp`and`tearDown`should be called. Not calling those methods could affect the test and
      make it inaccurate. This option should be used with caution.:::note
If the selected method is `oneTimeSetUp` or `oneTimeTearDown`,
      this option should be checked.

Append assertion errorBy default, the sampler will not append the assert failures
      to the failure message. To see the message in the result tree, check the option.Append runtime exceptionBy default, the sampler will not append the exceptions
      to the failure message. To see the stacktrace, check the optionThe current implementation of the sampler will try to create an instance using the string constructor
first. If the test class does not declare a string constructor, the sampler will look for an empty
constructor. Example below:

Empty Constructor:```

public class myTestCase {
  public myTestCase() {}
}

```

String Constructor:```

public class myTestCase {
  public myTestCase(String text) {
    super(text);
  }
}

```

By default, JMeter will provide some default values for the success/failure code and message.
Users should define a set of unique success and failure codes and use them uniformly across all tests.

Here is a short step-by-step.

1. Write your JUnit test and jar the classes
2. Copy and paste the jar files into `jmeter/lib/junit` directory
3. Start JMeter
4. Select `Test Plan`
5. Right click
     
       Add
       Thread Group
6. Select `Thread Group`
7. Right click
      
        Add
        Sampler
        JUnit Request
8. Enter `my unit test` in the name
9. Enter the package of your JUnit test
10. Select the class you want to test
11. Select a method to test
12. Enter `test successful` in success message
13. Enter `1000` in success code
14. Enter `test failed` in failure message
15. Enter `0001` in failure code
16. Select the Thread Group
17. Right click
      
        Add
        Listener
        View Results Tree

One benefit of the JUnit sampler is it allows the user to select any method from a variety
of unit tests to create a test plan. This should reduce the amount of code an user needs to
write to create a variety of test scenarios. From a basic set of test methods, different
sequences and tests can be created using JMeter's GUI.

For example:

Test Plan1

TestCase1.testImportCustomer
TestCase2.testUpdateRandomCustomer
TestCase1.testSelect100
TestCase2.testUpdateOrder
TestCase1.testSelect1000

TestPlan2

TestCase1.testImportCustomer
TestCase1.testSelect100
TestCase1.testSelect1000
TestCase2.testAdd100Customers

Here are some general guidelines for writing JUnit tests so they work well with JMeter. Since JMeter
runs multi-threaded, it is important to keep certain things in mind.

- Write the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods so they are thread safe. This
      generally means avoid using static members.
- Make the test methods discrete units of work and not long sequences of actions. By keeping
      the test method to a discrete operation, it makes it easier to combine test methods to create
      new test plans.
- Avoid making test methods depend on each other. Since JMeter allows arbitrary sequencing of
      test methods, the runtime behavior is different than the default JUnit behavior.
- If a test method is configurable, be careful about where the properties are stored. Reading
      the properties from the Jar file is recommended.
- Each sampler creates an instance of the test class, so write your test so the setup happens
      in `oneTimeSetUp` and `oneTimeTearDown`.
- If you select a class and no methods show up, it means the sampler had a problem creating an
      instance of the test class. The best way to debug this is to add some `System.out`
      to your class constructor and see what is happening.
