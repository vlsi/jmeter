# 19 Introduction

This document describes JMeter properties. The properties present in `jmeter.properties` or `reportgenerator.properties` should be set in the `user.properties` file.
These properties are only taken into account after restarting JMeter as they are usually resolved when the class is loaded.

# 19.1 Language


### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| language | No | Preferred GUI language. Comment out to use the JVM default locale's language.        Example: language=en     This property is the only one that must be set in jmeter.properties file     To fully configure language ensure you set locale, see Internationalization: Understanding Locale in the Java Platform.     Example for English:     -Duser.language=en -Duser.region=EN |
| locales.add | No | Additional locale(s) to add to the displayed list.        The current default list is: `en`, `fr`,     `de`, `no`, `es`, `tr`,     `ja`, `zh_CN`,     `zh_TW`, `pl`, `pt_BR`.        See `JMeterMenuBar#makeLanguageMenu()`        The entries are a comma-separated list of language names.        Example: locales.add=zu |

# 19.2 XML Parser


### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xpath.namespace.config | No | Path to a Properties file containing Namespace mapping in the form `prefix=Namespace`.     Example: ns=http://biz.aol.com/schema/2006-12-18 |
| xpath2query.parser.cache.size | No | XPath2 query cache for storing compiled XPath queries     Defaults to `400` |

# 19.3 SSL configuration

:::note
SSL (Java) System properties are now in `system.properties`  

JMeter no longer converts `javax.xxx` property entries in
`jmeter.properties` into System properties. These must now be
defined in the `system.properties` file or on the command-line. The
`system.properties` file gives more flexibility.
:::


### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https.sessioncontext.shared | No | By default, SSL session contexts are now created per-thread, rather than being shared.        The old behaviour can be enabled by setting this property to `true`. Defaults to: `false` |
| https.default.protocol | No | Be aware that https default protocol may vary depending on the version of JVM.     See [Diagnosing TLS, SSL and HTTPS](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/diagnosing_tls_ssl_and_https)     and [Bug 58236](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58236).     Default HTTPS protocol level: https.default.protocol=TLS     This may need to be changed to: https.default.protocol=SSLv3 |
| https.socket.protocols | No | List of protocols to enable. You may have to select only a subset if you find issues with target server.        This is needed when server does not support Socket version negotiation, this can lead to errors like:     `javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated`     or `java.net.SocketException: Connection reset`.        See [Bug 54759](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54759), example: https.socket.protocols=SSLv2Hello SSLv3 TLSv1 |
| https.cipherSuites | No | Comma-separated list of SSL cipher suites that may be used in HTTPS     connections.  It may be desirable to use a subset of cipher suites in order     to match expected client behavior or to reduce encryption overhead in     JMeter when running with large numbers of users. Errors may occur if the     JVM does not support the specified cipher suites, or if the cipher suites     supported by the HTTPS server do not overlap this list.  See the     [JSSE     Reference Guide.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization)        For example: https.cipherSuites=TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256     If not specified, JMeter will use the default list of cipher suites     supported by the JVM. |
| httpclient.reset_state_on_thread_group_iteration | No | Reset HTTP State when starting a new Thread Group iteration. In summary`true` means next iteration is associated to a new user. `false` means next iteration is associated to same user. `true` involves:       Closing opened connection     resetting SSL State  Defaults to: `true` |
| https.use.cached.ssl.context | No | Control if we allow reuse of cached SSL context between iterations.        Set the value to `false` to reset the SSL context each iteration.        Defaults to: `true`     DEPRECATED, you should use httpclient.reset_state_on_thread_group_iteration with correct value |
| https.keyStoreStartIndex | No | Start index to be used with keystores with many entries.        The default is to use entry `0`, i.e. the first.        Defaults to: `0` |
| https.keyStoreEndIndex | No | End index to be used with keystores with many entries.        Defaults to: `0` |

# 19.4 Look and Feel configuration


### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jmeter.laf.windows_10 | No | Classname of the Swing default UI        The LAF classnames that are available are now displayed as ToolTip text when hovering over     the Options/Look and Feel selection list.        You can either use a full class name, as shown below, or one of the strings "`System`"     or "`CrossPlatform`" which means JMeter will use the     corresponding string returned by `UIManager.get<name>LookAndFeelClassName()`.        LAF can be overridden by `os.name` (lowercased, spaces replaced by '_').                 Take for example an os.name of Windows 10.         JMeter would look first for a property         jmeter.laf.windows_10=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel         Failing that, the OS family os.name would be used shortened to the first space. In our example         JMeter would therefore look for a property         jmeter.laf.windows=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel                   Mac apparently looks better with the System LAF set through         jmeter.laf.mac=System         Failing that, the JMeter default LAF can be defined through:         jmeter.laf=System         If none of the above jmeter.laf properties are defined, JMeter uses the CrossPlatform LAF.         This is because the CrossPlatform LAF generally looks better than the System LAF.         See 52026 for details.          When you change Look and Feel (LAF) from JMeter GUI through menu Options > Look and Feel,     you should restart JMeter to ensure change is fully effective. |
| jmeter.loggerpanel.display | No | Display LoggerPanel.        Defaults to: `false` |
| jmeter.loggerpanel.enable_when_closed | No | Enable LogViewer Panel to receive log event even when closed.        Enabled since 2.12        Note this has some impact on performances, but as GUI mode must not be used for Load Test it is acceptable     Defaults to: `true` |
| jmeter.loggerpanel.maxlength | No | Max lines kept in LoggerPanel, `0` means no limit.         Defaults to: `1000` |
| jmeter.gui.refresh_period | No | Interval period in `ms` to process the events of the listeners.        Defaults to: `500` |

Set it to a number greater than zero (`25` can be a good default).        The bigger it is, the more memory will be consumed.     Defaults to: `0` |
| gui.quick_X | No | Hotkeys to add JMeter components where `X` is the shortcut key, for example:  gui.quick_0=ThreadGroupGui gui.quick_1=HttpTestSampleGui gui.quick_2=RegexExtractorGui gui.quick_3=AssertionGui gui.quick_4=ConstantTimerGui gui.quick_5=TestActionGui gui.quick_6=JSR223PostProcessor gui.quick_7=JSR223PreProcessor gui.quick_8=DebugSampler gui.quick_9=ViewResultsFullVisualizer      Above code will add the corresponding elements when you press     Ctrl+0 …     Ctrl+9     (⌘+0 …     ⌘+9 on Mac) |

# 19.6 JMX Backup configuration


### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jmeter.gui.action.save.backup_on_save | No | Enable auto backups of the `.jmx` file when a test plan is saved.        When enabled, before the `.jmx` is saved, it will be backed up to the directory     pointed to by the `jmeter.gui.action.save.backup_directory` property (see below).     Backup file names are built after the jmx file being saved. For example,     saving `test-plan.jmx` will create a `test-plan-000012.jmx` in the backup     directory provided that the last created backup file is `test-plan-000011.jmx`.        Default value is `true` indicating that auto backups are enabled.        Defaults to: `true` |
| jmeter.gui.action.save.backup_directory | No | Set the backup directory path where JMX backups will be created upon save in the GUI.        If not set (what it defaults to) then backup files will be created in a sub-directory of     the JMeter base installation. If set and the directory does not exist, a corresponding directory will be created.        Defaults to: `${JMETER_HOME}/backups` |
| jmeter.gui.action.save.keep_backup_max_hours | No | Set the maximum time (in hours) that backup files should be preserved since the save time.        By default no expiration time is set which means we keep backups for ever.        Defaults to: `0` |
| jmeter.gui.action.save.keep_backup_max_count | No | Set the maximum number of backup files that should be preserved.     By default ten backups will be preserved.        Setting this to zero will cause the backups to not being deleted (unless `keep_backup_max_hours`     is set to a non zero value).        Defaults to: `10` |
| save_automatically_before_run | No | Enable auto saving of the .jmx file before start run a test plan    When enabled, before the run, the .jmx will be saved and also backed up to the directory pointed.    Defaults to: `true` |

| client.rmi.localport | No | Parameter that controls the RMI ports used by `RemoteSampleListenerImpl` and `RemoteThreadsListenerImpl` (The Controller)        Default value is `0`, which means ports are randomly assigned.     If this is non-zero, it will be used as the base for local port numbers for the client engine.     At the moment JMeter will open up to three ports beginning with the port defined in this property.     You may need to open corresponding ports in the firewall on the Controller machine.     Defaults to: `0` |
| client.tries | No | When distributed test is starting, there may be several attempts to initialize remote engines.        By default, only a single try is made. Increase this property to make it retry additional times.        Defaults to: `1` |

| cache_manager.cached_resource_mode | No | N.B. This property is currently a temporary solution for 56162.     Since version 2.12, JMeter does not create anymore a Sample Result with a response     code of `204` for a resource found in cache. This is in line with what browser do.        You can choose between three modes:              RETURN_NO_SAMPLE (default)         this mode returns no Sample Result. It has no additional configuration.         RETURN_200_CACHE         this mode will return Sample Result with response code to 200 and         response message to "(ex cache)".         RETURN_CUSTOM_STATUS         choosing this mode, response code and message have to be set by specifying         RETURN_CUSTOM_STATUS.code and RETURN_CUSTOM_STATUS.message.          Defaults to: `RETURN_NO_SAMPLE` |

# 19.22 Remote batching configuration

Configure how SampleResults are sent from server to client when using distributed testing.

:::note
Note that the mode is currently resolved on the client, while other properties
    (e.g. `time_threshold`) are resolved on the server.
:::

Since JMeter version 2.9, default is `StrippedBatch`, which returns samples in
    batch mode (every 100 samples or every minute by default).  

    You can set mode by configuring:

```
mode=one of the possible modes below
```

:::note
StrippedBatch strips response data from SampleResult, so if you need the response data, change to another mode.
:::

Possible modes are:

`Standard`Sends SampleResult one by one`Batch`Accumulates SampleResults before sending them. Configured by
        properties`num_sample_threshold`and`time_threshold``Statistical`returns sample summary statistics. Configured by
        properties`key_on_threadname`and`time_threshold``Stripped`Similar to`Standard`mode but strips Response from SampleResult.
        Configured by property`sample_sender_strip_also_on_error``StrippedBatch`Same as`Batch`but strips Response from SampleResult.
        Configured by properties`num_sample_threshold`,`time_threshold`and`sample_sender_strip_also_on_error``Asynch`Asynchronous sender; uses a queue and background worker process to return the samples.
        Configured by property`asynch.batch.queue.size``StrippedAsynch`Same as`Asynch`but strips response data from SampleResult.
        Configured by properties`asynch.batch.queue.size`and`sample_sender_strip_also_on_error``StrippedDiskStore`Same as`DiskStore`but strips response data from SampleResultClass extending`AbstractSampleSender`(`org.example.load.MySampleSender`for example)A custom implementation of your choice

### Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| search_paths | No | List of directories (separated by `;`) to search for additional     JMeter plugin classes, for example new GUI elements and samplers.        Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included; jar files in sub directories are ignored.        The given value is in addition to any jars found in the `lib/ext` directory.        Do not use this for utility or plugin dependency jars.        Defaults to empty value. |
| user.classpath | No | List of directories that JMeter will search for utility and plugin dependency classes.        Use your platform path separator (`java.io.File.pathSeparatorChar` in Java) to separate multiple paths.        Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included; jar files in sub directories are ignored.        The given value is in addition to any jars found in the `lib` directory.        All entries will be added to the class path of the system class loader and also to the path     of the JMeter internal loader.        Paths with spaces may cause problems for the JVM.        Defaults to empty value. |
| plugin_dependency_paths | No | List of directories (separated by `;`) that JMeter will search for utility     and plugin dependency classes.        Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included; jar files in sub directories are ignored.

All entries will be added to the path of the JMeter internal loader only.        For plugin dependencies this property should be used instead of `user.classpath`.        Defaults to empty value. |
| classfinder.functions.contain | No | The classpath finder currently needs to load every single JMeter class to find the classes it needs.        For CLI mode, it's only necessary to scan for Function classes, but all classes are still loaded.        All current Function classes include "`.function.`" in their name, and none include     "`.gui.`" in the name, so the number of unwanted classes loaded can be reduced by     checking for these. However, if a valid function class name does not match these restrictions,     it will not be loaded. If problems are encountered, then comment or change this or the following property.        Defaults to: `.functions.` |
| classfinder.functions.notContain | No | Defaults to: `.gui.` |
