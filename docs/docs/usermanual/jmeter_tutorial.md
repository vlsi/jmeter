# 29. How to write a plugin for JMeter

### Introduction from Peter Lin

On more than one occasion, users have complained JMeter's developer documentation is out of
date and not very useful. In an effort to make it easier for developers, I decided to write a simple
step-by-step tutorial. When I mentioned this to mike, he had some ideas about what the tutorial
should cover.

Before we dive into the tutorial, I'd like to say writing a plugin isn't necessarily easy, even for
someone with several years of java experience. The first extension I wrote for JMeter was a
simple utility to parse HTTP access logs and produce requests in XML format. It wasn't really a
plugin, since it was a stand alone command line utility. My first real plugin for JMeter was the
webservice sampler. I was working on a .NET project and needed to stress test a webservice.
Most of the commercial tools out there for testing .NET webservices suck and cost too much.
Rather than fork over several hundred dollars for a lame testing tool, or a couple thousand dollars
for a good one, I decided it was easier and cheaper to write a plugin for JMeter.

After a two weeks of coding on my free time, I had a working prototype using Apache Soap driver.
I submitted it back to JMeter and mike asked me if I want to be a committer. I had contributed
patches to Jakarta JSTL and tomcat in the past, so I considered it an honor. Since then, I've
written the access log sampler, Tomcat 5 monitor and distribution graph. Mike has since then
improved the access log sampler tremendously and made it much more useful.

### Introduction from Mike Stover

One of my primary goals in designing JMeter was to make it easy to write plugins to enhance as
many of JMeter's features as possible. Part of the benefit of being open-source is that a lot of
people could potentially lend their efforts to improve the application. I made a conscious decision
to sacrifice some simplicity in the code to make plugin writing a way of life for a JMeter developer.

While some folks have successfully dug straight into the code and made improvements to JMeter,
a real tutorial on how to do this has been lacking. I tried a long time ago to write some
documentation about it, but most people did not find it useful. Hopefully, with Peter's help, this
attempt will be more successful.

JMeter is organized by protocols and functionality. This is done so that developers can build new
jars for a single protocol without having to build the entire application. We'll go into the details of
building JMeter later in the tutorial. Since most of the JMeter developers use eclipse, the article will
use eclipse directory as a reference point.

Root directory - `/eclipse/workspace/apache-jmeter/`

The folders inside of `apache-jmeter`

`bin`contains the`.bat`and`.sh`files for starting JMeter.
      It also contains`ApacheJMeter.jar`and properties file`build/docs`directory contains the JMeter documentation files`extras`ant related extra files`lib`contains the required jar files for JMeter`lib/ext`contains the core jar files for JMeter and the protocols`src`contains subdirectory for each protocol and component`src/*/test`unit test related directory`src/testFixtures`Directory that contains test-related code that might be reused in other modules`xdocs`XML files for documentation. JMeter generates its documentation from XML.As the tutorial progresses, an explanation of the subdirectories will be provided. For now, lets
focus on `src` directory.

The folders inside of `src`

The exception to the
rule is the Tomcat5 monitor. It is separate, because the functionality of the monitor is slightly
different than stress or functional testing. It may eventually be reorganized, but for now it is in its
own directory. In terms of difficulty, writing visualizers is probably one of the harder plugins to
write.

JMeter uses classpath scanning to detect plugins (e.g. functions, components, views). However, classpath scanning
      is expensive,
      so JMeter also provides a service lookup mechanism to allow plugins to be found without scanning the classpath.
      That is if a plugin registers a Java service with `META-INF/services`, then JMeter won't need to scan
      the classpath to find it.

Some of the existing features already use the new service lookup mechanism, but it is not yet used for all
      features.
      The interfaces that are supported for service loading are marked with
      `org.apache.jorphan.reflect.JMeterService`
      annotation.

Implementing a service the same as regular interface implementation, except you need to register the service
      in a `META-INF/services/fully.qualified.interface.name`.
      For instance you could use `@AutoService` to generate the file automatically at the build time.
      Here's how `__counter` function is declared in JMeter itself:

import com.google.auto.service.AutoService;

@AutoService(Function.class)
public class IterationCounter extends AbstractFunction implements ThreadListener {

For backward compatibility reasons, JMeter would still try searching the implementations with classpath scanning,
      so you don't have to use `META-INF/services` for registering services. However, service lookup is much
      faster, so exposing services would improve startup time, especially when there are many plugins.

As you add `META-INF/services` to your plugins, you can add `JMeter-Skip-Class-Scanning: true`
      manifest attribute so JMeter knows there's no need to scan the jar as it provides all the plugins via services.

When writing any JMeter component, there are certain contracts you must be aware of – ways a
JMeter component is expected to behave if it will run properly in the JMeter environment. This
section describes the contract that the GUI part of your component must fulfill.

GUI code in JMeter is strictly separated from Test Element code. Therefore, when you write a
component, there will be a class for the Test Element, and another for the GUI presentation. The
GUI presentation class is stateless in the sense that it should never hang onto a reference to the
Test Element (there are exceptions to this though).

A GUI element should extend the appropriate abstract class provided:

- `AbstractSamplerGui`
- `AbstractAssertionGui`
- `AbstractConfigGui`
- `AbstractControllerGui`
- `AbstractPostProcessorGui`
- `AbstractPreProcessorGui`
- `AbstractVisualizer`
- `AbstractTimerGui`

These abstract classes provide so much plumbing work for you that not extending them, and
instead implementing the interfaces directly is hardly an option. If you have some burning need to
not extend these classes, then you can join me in IRC where I can convince you otherwise :-).

So, you've extended the appropriate GUI class, what's left to do? Follow these steps:

1. Implement `getLabelResource()`
    
      This method should return the name of the resource that represents the title/name of the
component. The resource will have to be entered into JMeters messages.properties file
(and possibly translations as well).
2. Override `org.apache.jmeter.gui.JMeterGUIComponent.makeTestElement` method so it returns
  the appropriate `TestElement`. JMeter will use `makeTestElement` when user creates the element
  from the UI. In most cases it should be just creating the test element like
  `return new SetupThreadGroup()`.
3. Create your GUI. Whatever style you like, layout your GUI. Your class ultimately extends
    `JPanel`, so your layout must be in your class's own `ContentPane`.
    Do not hook up GUI elements to your `TestElement` class via actions and events.
    Let swing's internal model hang onto all the data as much as you possibly can.
    
      Some standard GUI stuff should be added to all JMeter GUI components:
        
          Call setBorder(makeBorder()) for your class. This will give it the standard JMeter
border
          Add the title pane via makeTitlePanel(). Usually this is the first thing added to your
            GUI, and should be done in a Box vertical layout scheme, or with JMeter's VerticalLayout
            class. Here is an example init() method:

private void init() {
    setLayout(new BorderLayout());
    setBorder(makeBorder());
    Box box = Box.createVerticalBox();
    box.add(makeTitlePanel());
    box.add(makeSourcePanel());
    add(box,BorderLayout.NORTH);
    add(makeParameterPanel(),BorderLayout.CENTER);
}
4. Then you need to wire UI elements with the properties of the new `TestElement`. If you create
  `TestElementSchema` for your test element (see `ThreadGroupSchema`), then you could use
  automatic wiring with `PropertyEditorCollection`
5. If you do not use schema for wiring properties to UI control, or if you have non-trivial controls,
    you might customize `TestElement` properties to UI control mapping by overriding `public void configure(TestElement el)`
    
      Be sure to call super.configure(e). This will populate some of the data for you, like
      the name of the element. Note: JMeter reuses UI elements when user changes the active element in test tree,
      so you need to set all the text fields in configure method to avoid displaying stale contents.
      Use this method to set data into your GUI elements. Example:

public void configure(TestElement el) {
    super.configure(el);
    useHeaders.setSelected(
            el.getPropertyAsBoolean(RegexExtractor.USEHEADERS));
    useBody.setSelected(
            !el.getPropertyAsBoolean(RegexExtractor.USEHEADERS));
    regexField.setText(
            el.getPropertyAsString(RegexExtractor.REGEX));
    templateField.setText(
            el.getPropertyAsString(RegexExtractor.TEMPLATE));
    defaultField.setText(
            el.getPropertyAsString(RegexExtractor.DEFAULT));
    matchNumberField.setText(
            el.getPropertyAsString(RegexExtractor.MATCH_NUM));
    refNameField.setText(
            el.getPropertyAsString(RegexExtractor.REFNAME));
}

      
      If you do not use schema for wiring UI controls to TestElement properties,
         or if you want customized behavior, you might override public void modifyTestElement(TestElement e).
         It is the logical reverse of configure method.
         
           Call super.modifyTestElement(e). This will take care of some default data for
             you.
           Note: in most cases, you want to treat "empty field" as "absent property", so make sure to
           remove the property if the input field is empty.
           Example:

public void modifyTestElement(TestElement e) {
    super.modifyTestElement(e);
    e.setProperty(new BooleanProperty(
            RegexExtractor.USEHEADERS,
            useHeaders.isSelected()));
    e.setProperty(RegexExtractor.MATCH_NUMBER,
            matchNumberField.getText());
    if (e instanceof RegexExtractor) {
        RegexExtractor regex = (RegexExtractor)e;
        regex.setRefName(refNameField.getText());
        regex.setRegex(regexField.getText());
        regex.setTemplate(templateField.getText());
        regex.setDefaultValue(defaultField.getText());
    }
}

           
         
       
       If your UI includes controls that do not map to TestElement properties (sliders, tabs),
         then you might want to reset them when user switches the controls. You can do that by overriding
         clearGui() method and resetting the controls there.

The reason you cannot hold onto a reference for your Test Element is because JMeter reuses
instance of GUI class objects for multiple Test Elements. This saves a lot of memory. It also
makes it incredibly easy to write the GUI part of your new component. You still have to struggle
with the layout in Swing, but you don't have to worry about creating the right events and actions for
getting the data from the GUI elements into the `TestElement` where it can do some good. JMeter
knows when to call your configure, and `modifyTestElement` methods where you can do it in a very
straightforward way.

Writing Visualizers is somewhat of a special case, however.

:::note
Load Testing in GUI mode being a bad practice, you should not develop such plugin. Have
a look at more up to date components like:

:::

Of the component types, visualizers require greater depth in Swing than something like controllers,
functions or samplers. You can find the full source for the distribution graph in
`components/org/apache/jmeter/visualizers/`. The distribution graph visualizer is divided into two
classes.

`DistributionGraphVisualizer`visualizer which JMeter instantiates`DistributionGraph`JComponent which draws the actual graphThe easiest way to write a visualizer is to do the following:

1. Extend `org.apache.jmeter.visualizers.gui.AbstractVisualizer`
2. Implement any additional interfaces need for call back and event notification.
     For example, the `DistributionGraphVisualizer` implements the following interfaces:
     
       ImageVisualizer
       ItemListener – according to the comments in the class,
         ItemListener is out of date and isn't used anymore.
       GraphListener
       Clearable

`AbstractVisualizer` provides some common functionality, which most visualizers like
`Graph Results` use. The common functionality provided by the abstract class includes:

- Configure test elements – This means it create a new `ResultCollector`, sets the file and sets the error log
- Create the stock menu
- Update the test element when changes are made
- Create a file panel for the log file
- Create the title panel

In some cases, you may not want to display the menu for the file textbox. In that case, you can
override the `init()` method. Here is the implementation for `DistributionGraphVisualizer`.

```

/**
 * Initialize the GUI.
 */
private void init() {
    this.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

    // MAIN PANEL
    Border margin = new EmptyBorder(10, 10, 5, 10);
    this.setBorder(margin);

    // Set up the graph with header, footer, Y axis and graph display
    JPanel graphPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
    graphPanel.add(createGraphPanel(), BorderLayout.CENTER);
    graphPanel.add(createGraphInfoPanel(), BorderLayout.SOUTH);

    // Add the main panel and the graph
    this.add(makeTitlePanel(), BorderLayout.NORTH);
    this.add(graphPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
}

```

The first thing the `init` method does is create a new `BorderLayout`. Depending on how you want to
layout the widgets, you may want to use a different layout manager. Keep mind using different
layout managers is for experts.

The second thing the `init` method does is create a border. If you want to increase or decrease
the border, change the four integer values. Each integer value represents pixels. If you want your
visualizer to have no border, skip lines 8 and 9. Line 13 calls `createGraphPanel`, which is
responsible for configuring and adding the `DistributionGraph` to the visualizer.

```

private Component createGraphPanel() {
    graphPanel = new JPanel();
    graphPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createBevelBorder(
    BevelBorder.LOWERED,Color.lightGray,Color.darkGray));
    graphPanel.add(graph);
    graphPanel.setBackground(Color.white);
    return graphPanel;
}

```

At line 5, the graph component is added to the graph panel. The constructor is where a new
instance of `DistributionGraph` is created.

```

public DistributionGraphVisualizer() {
    model = new SamplingStatCalculator("Distribution");
    graph = new DistributionGraph(model);
    graph.setBackground(Color.white);
    init();
}

```

The constructor of `DistributionGraphVisualizer` is responsible for creating the model and the
graph. Every time a new result is complete, the engine passes the result to all the listeners by
calling `add(SampleResult res)`. The visualizer passes the new `SampleResult` to the model.

```

public synchronized void add(SampleResult res) {
    model.addSample(res);
    updateGui(model.getCurrentSample());
}

```

In the case of the `DistributionGraphVisualizer`, the `add` method doesn't actually update the
graph. Instead, it calls `updateGui` in line three.

```

public synchronized void updateGui(Sample s) {
    // We have received one more sample
    if (delay == counter) {
        updateGui();
        counter = 0;
    } else {
        counter++;
    }
}

```

Unlike `GraphVisualizer`, the distribution graph attempts to show how the results clump; therefore
the `DistributionGraphVisualizer` delays the update. The default delay is `10` sampleresults.

```

public synchronized void updateGui() {
    if (graph.getWidth() < 10) {
        graph.setPreferredSize(
                new Dimension(getWidth() - 40,
                getHeight() - 160));
    }
    graphPanel.updateUI();
    graph.repaint();
}

```

Lines 2 to 3 are suppose to resize the graph, if the user resizes the window or drags the divider.
Line 7 updates the panel containing the graph. Line 8 triggers the update of the `DistributionGraph`.
Before we cover writing graphs, there are a couple of important methods visualizer must
implement.

```

public String getLabelResource() {
    return "distribution_graph_title";
}

```

The label resource retrieves the name of the visualizer from the properties file. The file is located
in `core/org/apache/jmeter/resources`. It's best not to hardcode the name of the visualizer.
`Message.properties` file is organized alphabetically, so adding a new entry is easy.

```

public synchronized void clear() {
    this.graph.clear();
    model.clear();
    repaint();
}

```

Every component in JMeter should implement logic for `clear()` method. If this isn't done, the
component will not clear the UI or model when the user tries to clear the last results and run a
new test. If clear is not implemented, it can result in a memory leak.

```

public JComponent getPrintableComponent() {
    return this.graphPanel;
}

```

The last method visualizers should implement is `getPrintableComponent()`. The method is
responsible for returning the JComponent that can be saved or printed. This feature was recently
added so that users can save a screen capture of any given visualizer.

:::note
Load Testing in GUI mode being a bad practice, you should not develop such plugin. Have
a look at more up to date components like:

Web report
Real-Time results with BackendListenerClient
:::

Visualizers should implement `GraphListener`. This is done to make it simpler to add new Sample
instances to listeners. As a general rule, if the custom graph does not plot every single sample,
it does not need to implement the interface.

```

public interface GraphListener {
    public void updateGui(Sample s);
    public void updateGui();
}

```

The important method in the interface is `updateGui(Sample s)`. From
`DistributionGraphVisualizer`, we see it calls `graph.repaint()`
to refresh the graph. In most cases,
the implementation of `updateGui(Sample s)` should do just that.
`ItemListenerVisualizers` generally do not need to implement this interface. The interface is used with combo
boxes, checkbox and lists. If your visualizer uses one of these and needs to know when it has
been updated, the visualizer will need to implement the interface. For an example of how to
implement the interface, please look at `GraphVisualizer`.

:::

For those new to Swing and haven't written custom JComponents yet, I would suggest getting a
book on Swing and get a good feel for how Swing widgets work. This tutorial will not attempt to
explain basic Swing concepts and assumes the reader is already familiar with the Swing API and
MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern. From the constructor of `DistributionGraphVisualizer`,
we see a new instance of `DistributionGraph` is created with an instance of the model.

```

public DistributionGraph(SamplingStatCalculator model) {
    this();
    setModel(model);
}

```

The implementation of `setModel` method is straight forward.

```

private void setModel(Object model) {
    this.model = (SamplingStatCalculator) model;
    repaint();
}

```

Notice the method calls `repaint` after it sets the model. If `repaint` isn't called, it can cause the
GUI to not draw the graph. Once the test starts, the graph would redraw, so calling `repaint` isn't
critical.

```

public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    final SamplingStatCalculator m = this.model;
    synchronized (m) {
        drawSample(m, g);
    }
}

```

The other important aspect of updating the widget is placing the call to `drawSample` within a
synchronized block. If `drawSample` wasn't synchronized, JMeter would throw a
`ConcurrentModificationException` at runtime. Depending on the test plan, there may be a dozen or
more threads adding results to the model. The synchronized block does not affect the accuracy of
each individual request and time measurement, but it does affect JMeter's ability to generate large
loads. As the number of threads in a test plan increases, the likelihood a thread will have to wait
until the graph is done redrawing before starting a new request increases. Here is the
implementation of `drawSample`.

```

private void drawSample(SamplingStatCalculator model, Graphics g) {
    width = getWidth();
    double height = (double)getHeight() - 1.0;

    // first lets draw the grid
    for (int y=0; y < 4; y++){
        int q1 = (int)(height - (height * 0.25 * y));
        g.setColor(Color.lightGray);
        g.drawLine(xborder,q1,width,q1);
        g.setColor(Color.black);
        g.drawString(String.valueOf((25 * y) + "%"),0,q1);
    }
    g.setColor(Color.black);
    // draw the X axis
    g.drawLine(xborder,(int)height,width,(int)height);
    // draw the Y axis
    g.drawLine(xborder,0,xborder,(int)height);
    // the test plan has to have more than 200 samples
    // for it to generate half way decent distribution
    // graph. The larger the sample, the better the
    // results.
    if (model != null && model.getCount() > 50) {
        // now draw the bar chart
        Number ninety = model.getPercentPoint(0.90);
        Number fifty = model.getPercentPoint(0.50);
        total = model.getCount();
        Collection values = model.getDistribution().values();
        Object[] objval = new Object[values.size()];
        objval = values.toArray(objval);
        // we sort the objects
        Arrays.sort(objval,new NumberComparator());
        int len = objval.length;
        for (int count=0; count < len; count++) {
            // calculate the height
            Number[] num = (Number[])objval[count];
            double iper = (double)num[1].intValue() / (double)total;
            double iheight = height * iper;
            // if the height is less than one, we set it
            // to one pixel
            if (iheight < 1) {
                iheight = 1.0;
            }
            int ix = (count * 4) + xborder + 5;
            int dheight = (int)(height - iheight);
            g.setColor(Color.blue);
            g.drawLine(ix -1,(int)height,ix -1,dheight);
            g.drawLine(ix,(int)height,ix,dheight);
            g.setColor(Color.black);
            // draw a red line for 90% point
            if (num[0].longValue() == ninety.longValue()) {
                g.setColor(Color.red);
                g.drawLine(ix,(int)height,ix,55);
                g.drawLine(ix,(int)35,ix,0);
                g.drawString("90%",ix - 30,20);
                g.drawString(
                        String.valueOf(num[0].longValue()),
                        ix + 8, 20);
            }
            // draw an orange line for 50% point
            if (num[0].longValue() == fifty.longValue()) {
                g.setColor(Color.orange);
                g.drawLine(ix,(int)height,ix,30);
                g.drawString("50%",ix - 30,50);
                g.drawString(
                        String.valueOf(num[0].longValue()),
                        ix + 8, 50);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

In general, the rendering of the graph should be fairly quick and shouldn't be a bottleneck. As a
general rule, it is a good idea to profile custom plugins. The only way to make sure a visualizer
isn't a bottleneck is to run it with a tool like Borland OptimizeIt. A good way to test a plugin is to
create a simple test plan and run it. The heap and garbage collection behavior should be regular
and predictable.

In this part, we will go through the process of creating a simple component for JMeter that uses
the new `TestBean` framework.

This component will be a CSV file reading element that will let users easily vary their input data
using CSV files. To most effectively use this tutorial, open the three files specified below (found in
JMeter's `src/components` directory).

1. Pick a package and make three files:
    
      [ComponentName].java (org.apache.jmeter.config.CSVDataSet.java)
      [ComponentName]BeanInfo.java (org.apache.jmeter.config.CSVDataSetBeanInfo.java)
      [ComponentName]Resources.properties (org.apache.jmeter.config.CSVDataSetResources.properties)
2. `CSVDataSet.java` must implement the `TestBean` interface. In addition, it will extend
    `ConfigTestElement`, and implement `LoopIterationListener`.
    
      TestBean is a marker interface, so there are no methods to implement.
      Extending ConfigTestElement will make our component a Config element in a test
        plan. By extending different abstract classes, you can control the type of element your
        component will be (i.e. AbstractSampler, AbstractVisualizer, GenericController, etc -
        though you can also make different types of elements just by instantiating the right
        interfaces, the abstract classes can make your life easier).
3. `CSVDataSetBeanInfo.java` should extend `org.apache.jmeter.testbeans.BeanInfoSupport`
    
      create a zero-parameter constructor in which we call super(CSVDataSet.class);
      we'll come back to this.
4. `CSVDataSetResources.properties` - blank for now
5. Implement your special logic for you plugin class.
    
      The CSVDataSet will read a single CSV file and will store the values it finds into
        JMeter's running context. The user will define the file, define the variable names for
        each "column". The CSVDataSet will open the file when the test starts, and close it
        when the test ends (thus we implement TestListener). The CSVDataSet will update
        the contents of the variables for every test thread, and for each iteration through its
        parent controller, by reading new lines in the file. When we reach the end of the file,
        we'll start again at the beginning.
        When implementing a TestBean, pay careful
        attention to your properties. These properties will become the basis of a GUI form by
        which users will configure the CSVDataSet element.
      
      Your element will be cloned by JMeter when the test starts. Each thread will get its
        own instance. However, you will have a chance to control how the cloning is done, if
        you need it.
      
      Properties: filename, variableNames. With public getters and setters.
        
          filename is self-explanatory, it will hold the name of the CSV file we'll read
          variableNames is a String which will allow a user to enter the names of the
            variables we'll assign values to. Why a String? Why not a Collection? Surely
            users will need to enter multiple (and unknown number of) variable names? True,
            but if we used a List or Collection, we'd have to write a GUI component to handle
            collections, and I just want to do this quickly. Instead, we'll let users input
            comma-delimited list of variable names.
        
      
      I then implemented the IterationStart method of the LoopIterationListener interface.
        The point of this "event" is that your component is notified of when the test has entered
        its parent controller. For our purposes, every time the CSVDataSet's parent controller
        is entered, we will read a new line of the data file and set the variables. Thus, for a
        regular controller, each loop through the test will result in a new set of values being
        read. For a loop controller, each iteration will do likewise. Every test thread will get
        different values as well.
6. Setting up your GUI elements in `CSVDataSetBeanInfo`:
    
      You can create groupings for your component's properties. Each grouping you create
        needs a label and a list of property names to include in that grouping. I.e.:

createPropertyGroup("csv_data",
        new String[] { "filename", "variableNames" });

      
      Creates a grouping called csv_data that will include GUI input elements for the
        filename and variableNames properties of CSVDataSet.
        Then, we need to define what kind of properties we want these to be:

p = property("filename");
p.setValue(NOT_UNDEFINED, Boolean.TRUE);
p.setValue(DEFAULT, "");
p.setValue(NOT_EXPRESSION, Boolean.TRUE);

p = property("variableNames");
p.setValue(NOT_UNDEFINED, Boolean.TRUE);
p.setValue(DEFAULT, "");
p.setValue(NOT_EXPRESSION, Boolean.TRUE);

        This essentially creates two properties whose value is not allowed to be null, and
        whose default values are "". There are several such attributes that can be set for each
        property. Here is a rundown:

        
          NOT_UNDEFINEDThe property will not be left null.
          DEFAULTA default values must be given if NOT_UNDEFINED is true.
          NOT_EXPRESSIONThe value will not be parsed for functions if this is true.
          NOT_OTHERThis is not a free form entry field – a list of values has to be provided.
          TAGSWith a String[] as the value, this sets up a predefined
            list of acceptable values, and JMeter will create a dropdown select.
        

        Additionally, a custom property editor can be specified for a property:


p.setPropertyEditorClass(FileEditor.class);


        This will create a text input plus browse button that opens a dialog for finding a file.
        Usually, complex property settings are not needed, as now. For a more complex
        example, look at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.AccessLogSamplerBeanInfo
7. Defining your resource strings. In `CSVDataSetResources.properties` we have to define all our
    string resources. To provide translations, one would create additional files such as
    `CSVDataSetResources_ja.properties`, and `CSVDataSetResources_de.properties`. For our
    component, we must define the following resources:
    
      displayNameThis will provide a name for the element that will appear in menus.
      csv_data.displayNamewe create a property grouping called csv_data,
         so we have to provide a label for the grouping
      filename.displayNamea label for the filename input element.
      filename.shortDescriptiona tool-tip-like help text blurb.
      variableNames.displayNamea label for the variable name input element.
      variableNames.shortDescriptiontool tip for the variableNames input element.
8. Debug your component.

JMeter uses Gradle to compile and build the distribution. JMeter has
several tasks defined, which make it easier for developers to build the complete project.
For those unfamiliar with Gradle, it's a build tool similar to make on Unix.
A list of the Gradle tasks with a short description is provided
in [gradle.md](https://github.com/apache/jmeter/blob/master/gradle.md), which can be found
 in the root source directory.

Here are some example commands.

`./gradlew runGui`Build and start JMeter GUI`./gradlew createDist`Build project and copy relevant jar files to`./lib`folder`./gradlew :src:dist:previewSite`Creates preview of a site to`./build/docs/site`
