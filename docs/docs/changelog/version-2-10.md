### New and Noteworthy

Core ImprovementsNew Performance improvementsA Huge performance improvement has been made on High Throughput Tests (no pause), see 54777
An issue with unnecessary SSL Context reset has been fixed which improves performances of pure HTTP tests, see 55023
Important performance improvement in parsing of Embedded resource in HTML pages thanks to a switch to JODD/Lagarto HTML Parser, see 55632

New CSS/JQuery Tester in View Tree ResultsA new CSS/JQuery Tester in View Tree Results that makes CSS/JQuery Extractor a first class
citizen in JMeter, you can now test your expressions very easily



Many improvements in HTTP(S) Recording have been madeThe "HTTP Proxy Server" test element has been renamed as "HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder".


Better recording of HTTPS sites, embedded resources using subdomains will more easily be recorded when using JDK 7. See 55507.
See updated documentation: 

Redirection are now more smartly detected by HTTP Proxy Server, see 55531
Many fixes on edge cases with HTTPS have been made, see 55502, 55504, 55506
Many encoding fixes have been made, see 54482, 54142, 54293

You can now load test MongoDB through new MongoDB Source Config



Kerberos authentication has been added to Auth Manager

Device can now be used in addition to source IP address

You can now do functional testing of MongoDB scripts through new MongoDB Script

Timeout has been added to OS Process Sampler

Query timeout has been added to JDBC Request

New functions (__urlencode and __urldecode) are now available to encode/decode URL encoded chars

Continuous Integration is now eased by addition of a new flag that forces NON-GUI JVM to exit after test endSee jmeter property:

`jmeterengine.force.system.exit`

HttpSampler now allows DELETE Http Method to have a body (works for HC4 and HC31 implementations). This allows for example to test Elastic Search APIs

2 implementations of HtmlParser have been added to improve Embedded resources parsingYou can choose the implementation to use for parsing Embedded resources in HTML pages:
See jmeter.properties and look at property "htmlParser.className".

org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.parser.LagartoBasedHtmlParser for optimal performances
org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.parser.JSoupBasedHtmlParser for most accurate parsing and functional testing

Distributed testing has been improvedNumber of threads on each node are now reported to controller.








Performance improvement on BatchSampleSender(55423)
Addition of 2 SampleSender modes (StrippedAsynch and StrippedDiskStore), see jmeter.properties

ModuleController has been improved to better handle changes to referenced controllersImproved class loader configuration, see[Bug 55503](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55503)New property "plugin_dependency_paths" for plugin dependencies
Properties "search_paths", "user.classpath" and "plugin_dependency_paths"
    now automatically add all jars from configured directories

Best-practices section has been improved, ensure you read it to get the most out of JMeterSee [Best Practices](usermanual/best-practices.html)

GUI and ergonomy ImprovementsNew Templates feature that allows you to create test plan from existing template or merge
template into your Test Plan



Workbench can now be saved

Syntax color has been added to scripts elements (BeanShell, BSF, and JSR223), MongoDB and JDBC elements making code much more readable and allowing UNDO/REDO through CTRL+Z/CTRL+YBSF Sampler with syntax color

JSR223 Pre Processor with syntax color

Better editors are now available for Test Elements with large text content, like HTTP Sampler, and JMS related Test Element providing line numbering and allowing UNDO/REDO through CTRL+Z/CTRL+YJMeter GUI can now be fully Internationalized, all remaining issues have been fixedCurrently French has all its labels translated. Other languages are partly translated, feel free to
contribute translations by reading[Localisation (Translator's Guide)](localising/index.html)Moving elements in Test plan has been improved in many waysDrag and drop of elements in Test Plan tree is now much easier and possible on multiple nodes

**Note that due to this [bug in Java](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6560955),
you cannot drop a node after last node. The workaround is to drop it before this last node and then Drag and Drop the last node
before the one you just dropped.**

New shortcuts have been added to move elements in the tree.(alt + Arrow Up) and (alt + Arrow Down) move the element within the parent node  

(alt + Arrow Left) and (alt + Arrow Right) move the element up and down in the tree depth

Response Time Graph Y axis can now be scaled

JUnit Sampler gives now more details on configuration errors
### Known bugs

- The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).
- Listeners don't show iteration counts when a If Controller has a condition which is always false from the first iteration (see [Bug 52496](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52496)).
A workaround is to add a sampler at the same level as (or superior to) the If Controller.
For example a Test Action sampler with 0 wait time (which doesn't generate a sample),
or a Debug Sampler with all fields set to False (to reduce the sample size).
- Webservice sampler does not consider the HTTP response status to compute the status of a response, thus a response 500 containing a non empty body will be considered as successful, see [Bug 54006](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54006).
To workaround this issue, ensure you always read the response and add a Response Assertion checking text inside the response.
- The numbers that appear to the left of the green box are the number of active threads / total number of threads,
these only apply to a locally run test; they do not include any threads started on remote systems when using client-server mode, (see [Bug 54152](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54152)).
- Note that there is a [bug in Java](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6396599 )
on some Linux systems that manifests itself as the following error when running the test cases or JMeter itself:

 [java] WARNING: Couldn't flush user prefs:
 java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException:
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not supported: indent-number

This does not affect JMeter operation. This issue is fixed since Java 7b05.
- With Java 1.6 and Gnome 3 on Linux systems, the JMeter menu may not work correctly (shift between mouse's click and the menu).
This is a known Java bug (see  [Bug 54477 ](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54477 )).
A workaround is to use a Java 7 runtime (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK).
- With Oracle Java 7 and Mac Book Pro Retina Display, the JMeter GUI may look blurry.
This is a known Java bug, see Bug [JDK-8000629](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8000629).
A workaround is to use a Java 7 update 40 runtime which fixes this issue.


### Incompatible changes

- **SMTP Sampler** now uses eml file subject if subject field is empty
- With this version autoFlush has been turned off on PrintWriter in charge of writing test results.
This results in improved throughput for intensive tests but can result in more test data loss in case
of JMeter crash (extremely rare). To revert to previous behaviour set `jmeter.save.saveservice.autoflush` property to `true`.
- Shortcut for **Function Helper Dialog** is now *CTRL+SHIFT+F1 (CMD + SHIFT + F1 for Mac OS)*.
The original key sequence *(Ctrl+F1)* did not work in some locations (it is consumed by the Java Swing ToolTipManager).
It was therefore necessary to change the shortcut.
- **Webservice (SOAP) Request** has been removed by default from GUI as Element is deprecated. (Use **HTTP Request**
with *Body Data*, see also the Template *Building a SOAP Webservice Test Plan*), if you need to show it, see property `not_in_menu` in *jmeter.properties*
- **Transaction Controller** now sets *Response Code* of *Generated Parent Sampler*
(if *Generated Parent Sampler* is checked) to response code of first failing child in case of failure of one of the children, in previous versions *Response Code* was empty.
- In previous versions, **IncludeController** could run Test Elements located inside a **Thread Group**, this behaviour (*which was not documented*)
could result in weird behaviour, it has been removed in this version (see [Bug 55464](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55464)).
The correct way to include Test Elements is to use **Test Fragment** as stated in documentation of **Include Controller**.
- The retry count for the HttpClient 3.1 and HttpClient 4.x samplers has been changed to **0**.
Previously the default was 1, which could cause unexpected additional traffic.
- Starting with this version, the **HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder** tries to detect when a sample is the result of a previous
redirect. If the current response is a redirect, JMeter will save the redirect URL. When the next request is received,
it is compared with the saved redirect URL and if there is a match, JMeter will disable the generated sample.
To revert to previous behaviour, set the property `proxy.redirect.disabling=false`
- Starting with this version, in **HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder** if Grouping is set to *Put each group in a new Transaction Controller*,
the Recorder will create **Transaction Controller** instances with *Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample* set
to false. This default value reflect more accurately response time.
- `__escapeOroRegexpChars` function (which escapes ORO reserved characters) no longer trims the value (see [Bug 55328](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55328))
- The *commons-lang-2.6.jar* has been removed from embedded libraries in `jmeter/lib` folder as it is not needed by JMeter at run-time
(it is only used by Apache Velocity for generating documentation).
If you use any plugin or third-party code that depends on it, you need to add it in `jmeter/lib` folder
